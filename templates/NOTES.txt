{{- if .Values.caddy.enabled }}
To retrieve the external service IP (ClusterType: loadBalancer is required) of the Caddy server (which acts as the front-end for Lightwalletd), run the following command:

  kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-caddy -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

Once you have obtained the IP address from the above command, you will need to update your DNS records. Specifically, create or update an A record for your domain "{{ .Values.caddy.domain }}" to point to the retrieved IP address.
{{- end }}


{{- if .Values.dnsseeder.enabled }}
To retrieve the external service IP (ClusterType: loadBalancer is required) of the Zebrad or zcashd server (at least one should be exposed publicly if we are going to use the dnsseeder), run the following commands:

  For Zebra:
  kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Values.zebra.name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

  For Zcashd:
  kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Values.zcashd.name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

Once you have obtained the IP address from the above command, you will need to update your DNS records. Specifically, create or update an A record for your domain {{ .Values.dnsseeder.env.nodeHostname }} to point to the retrieved IP address.
{{- end }}


NOTE:
{{- if or .Values.caddy.enabled .Values.dnsseeder.enabled }}
You may need to wait a moment before running these commands, as your cluster needs time to acquire the public IP.
